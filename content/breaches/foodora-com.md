In April 2016, the online food delivery service <a href="https://www.databreachtoday.com/delivery-hero-confirms-foodora-data-breach-a-14435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foodora suffered a data breach</a> which was then extensively redistributed online. The breach included the personal information of hundreds of thousands of customers from multiple countries including their names, delivery addresses, phone numbers and passwords stored as either a salted MD5 or a bcrypt hash.
