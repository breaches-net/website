In November 2015, <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2015/11/when-children-are-breached-inside.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hackers extracted more than 4.8 million parents' and 227k children's accounts from VTech's Learning Lodge website</a>. The Hong Kong company produces learning products for children including software sold via the compromised website. The data breach exposed extensive personal details including home addresses, security questions and answers and passwords stored as weak MD5 hashes. Furthermore, children's details including names, ages, genders and associations to their parents' records were also exposed.
