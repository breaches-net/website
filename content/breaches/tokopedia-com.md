In April 2020, Indonesia's largest online store <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-leaks-15-million-records-from-tokopedia-indonesias-largest-online-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokopedia suffered a data breach</a>. The incident resulted in 15M rows of data being posted to a popular hacking forum. An additional 76M rows were later provided to HIBP in July 2020. In total, the data included over 71M unique email addresses alongside names, genders, birth dates and passwords stored as SHA2-384 hashes.
