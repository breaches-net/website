In December 2018, the data science website <a href="https://support.datacamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017716074-DataCamp-Security-Update-Frequently-Asked-Questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DataCamp suffered a data breach</a> of records dating back to January 2017. The incident exposed 760k unique email and IP addresses along with names and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. In 2019, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data appeared listed for sale on a dark web marketplace</a> (along with several other large breaches) and subsequently began circulating more broadly. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it to be attributed to &quot;BenjaminBlue@exploit.im&quot;.
