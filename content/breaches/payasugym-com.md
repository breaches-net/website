In December 2016, <a href="https://twitter.com/real_1x0123/status/809443917984911364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an attacker breached PayAsUGym's website</a> exposing over 400k customers' personal data. The data was consequently leaked publicly and broadly distributed via Twitter. The leaked data contained personal information including email addresses and passwords hashed using MD5 without a salt.
