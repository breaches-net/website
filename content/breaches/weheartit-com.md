In November 2013, the image-based social network <a href="http://help.weheartit.com/customer/portal/articles/2889018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Heart It suffered a data breach</a>. The incident wasn't discovered until October 2017 when 8.6 million user records were sent to HIBP. The data contained user names, email addresses and password hashes, 80% of which were salted SHA-256 with the remainder being MD5 with no salt.
