In September 2016, the paid-to-click site <a href="http://cybercashworldwide.com/clixsense-has-been-hacked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClixSense suffered a data breach</a> which exposed 2.4 million subscriber identities. The breached data was then posted online by the attackers who claimed it was a subset of a larger data breach totalling 6.6 million records. The leaked data was extensive and included names, physical, email and IP addresses, genders and birth dates, account balances and passwords stored as plain text.
